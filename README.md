# Graphics2D_Win32_Desktop_Project
Graphics2D_Win32_Desktop_Project Simple Drawing Application Based on Mathematics and Problem Solving with C++

 -Building computer graphics from scratch using mathematical equations and problem solving with C++ .
 
 -All proofs and theories used were built from scratch and implemented by hard coding .
 
 -No built in functions for the mathematics logic .
 
 -Scientific Algorithms implemented:
 
 Lines Drawing
 
 Circles Drawing
 
 Ellipse Drawing
 
 Point Clipping
 
 Line Clipping
 
 -The challenging part is in handling the mouse clicks and how to send the commands you want to the Win32 Application Window Menu in a correct way without interference between a command and another.

-Code handling to change colors, adding menus options and saving, reading and writing to external files.
